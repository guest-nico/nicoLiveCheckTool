      the same directory as the EXEs.


What's the point?
=================
BassWinamp is an extention to the BASS audio library, providing a set of functions for
adding Winamp Input plugins support. This adds more format support for the Bass library.


Requirements
============
BASS version 2.4


Using BassWinamp
=============
C/C++, Delphi, and Visual Basic APIs are provided, to use BassWinamp
with another language you'll first have to convert the header file. Or, as a
last resort, you could use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.

If you are updating your software from a previous BassWinamp version, then
you should check the "History" section (below), to see which (if any)
of the functions that you are using have been affected by a change.

For the BassWinamp functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.


Latest Version
==============
The latest version of BassWinamp can always be found at the Bass website:
