BASSZXTUNE v2.4.5



*** DESCRIPTION ***

BASSZXTUNE - BASS audio library add-on based on ZXTune library.

This add-on adds a support for chiptune tracker formats to BASS audio library. BASSZXTUNE is merely a wrapper around the upstream project ZXTune (http://zxtune.bitbucket.org/). All the hard work (decoding functionality) was done by the author of ZXTune.

Supported extensions: $b, $m, ahx, as0, asc, ay, ayc, bin, cc3, chi, cop, d, dmm, dsq, dst, esv, fdi, ftc, gam, gamplus, gbs, gtr, gym, hes, hrm, hrp, lzs, m, msp, mtc, nsf, nsfe, p, pcd, psc, psg, psm, pt1, pt2, pt3, s, sap, scl, sid, spc, sqd, sqt, st1, st3, stc, stp, str, szx, td0, tf0, tfc, tfd, tfe, tlz, tlzp, trd, trs, ts, vgm, vtx, ym.

Also, it's possible to open modules inside archives with common formats: zip, tar, rar, gzip, lzma.

Note: the following extensions are supported but will not be listed in BASS_PLUGININFO: txt, rar, zip.

Limitations:
    - "Supported extensions" doesn't mean "supported formats". Some files with the above mentioned extensions may not be supported by BASSZXTUNE. For a full list of supported formats look here: http://zxtune.bitbucket.org/info/features/
    - Buffered streams (STREAMFILE_BUFFER, STREAMFILE_BUFFERPUSH, etc) are not supported.
    - Streaming in blocks (BASS_STREAM_BLOCK) is not supported.
    - Internet streams (BASS_StreamCreateURL) are not supported.
    - Only mono and stereo output, no access to separate module channels.

Supported platforms:
    - MS Windows i686 & x86_64 (tested on MS Windows 10 64-bit)
    - Linux i686 & x86_64 (tested on Kubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak 64/32-bit)
    - OSX x86_64 (tested on OSX 10.12 Sierra)

*** BUILD INSTRUCTIONS ***

https://bitbucket.org/z80maniac/zxtune/src/master/apps/plugins/BUILD.TXT



*** USAGE ***

There are two ways you can use the add-on.
1) Use BASS_PluginLoad (recommended).
2) Load BASSZXTUNE library by yourself. You may use basszxtune.h and/or basszxtune.lib from the archive if needed. The following library functions are available:
    HSTREAM BASS_ZXTUNE_StreamCreateFile(BOOL mem, const void *file, QWORD offset, QWORD length, DWORD flags);
    HSTREAM BASS_ZXTUNE_StreamCreateFileUser(DWORD system, DWORD flags, const BASS_FILEPROCS *procs, void *user);
See the documentation regarding BASS_StreamCreate and BASS_StreamCreateFileUser. The same documentation may be applied to their BASS_ZXTUNE_* counterparts. Mind the limitations mentioned above, though.

To retreive tags in OGG format use BASS_ChannelGetTags(<handle>, BASS_TAG_OGG). Available tags: TYPE, TITLE, ARTIST, PROGRAM, COMPUTER, DATE, DESCRIPTION, VERSION, POSITIONS, LOOPPOSITION, PATTERNS, FRAMES, LOOPFRAME, CHANNELS, INITIALTEMPO, STRINGS. Not all tags may be present. The content of tags depends on a tune format.



*** CONFIGURATION OPTIONS ***

BASSZXTUNE supports one config option: BASS_CONFIG_ZXTUNE_MAXFILESIZE. This option specifies the maximum filesize that can be opened by the plugin. The specified constant can be found in consts.h.
Example usage: BASS_SetConfig(BASS_CONFIG_ZXTUNE_MAXFILESIZE, 1024*32) - only allow BASSZXTUNE to open files that are no bigger than 32KiB.
The default maximum file size is 2 MiB.



*** ARCHIVED FORMATS AND SUBTUNES ***

BASSZXTUNE supports archived and packed formats. Files with such formats may hold more than one logical module inside. These modules will be treated as parts of one continuous stream. The add-on will decode them one after another without gaps. The total length of the file is the sum of the lengths of all underlying modules. Everytime a stream jumps to a different logical module the BASS_SYNC_OGG_CHANGE is triggered.

There is a number of constants (which can be found in consts.h) that allow to retrieve the information about subtunes:
BASS_ChannelGetLength(<handle>, BASS_POS_ZXTUNE_SUB_COUNT) - the number of subtunes
BASS_ChannelGetLength(<handle>, BASS_POS_OGG) - the same as above
BASS_ChannelGetLength(<handle>, BASS_POS_ZXTUNE_SUB_LENGTH + <subtuneIndex>)) - the length of a particular subtune
BASS_ChannelGetTags(<handle>, BASS_TAG_ZXTUNE_SUB_OGG + <subtuneIndex>)) - get the tags of a particular subtune

If subtuneIndex (which is zero-based) is out of range then the function will fail with BASS_ERROR_POSITION. Info can be retrieved only for the first 65536 subtunes.
